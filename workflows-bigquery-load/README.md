This guide explains how to orchestrate a serverless scheduled data load from [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) and transform the data in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) using [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows), [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), and [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore).

For detailed steps, refer to the tutorial: [Load data from Cloud Storage to BigQuery using Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/tutorials/load-data-from-cloud-storage-to-bigquery-using-workflows).
