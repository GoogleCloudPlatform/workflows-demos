# Workflows Samples

![Workflows Logo](Workflows-128-color.png)

[Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows) allow you to orchestrate and
automate Google Cloud and HTTP-based API services with serverless workflows.

This repository contains a collection of samples for Workflows for various use
cases.

## Slides

There's a
[presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/meteatamel/serverless-orchestration-with-workflows)
that explains Workflows.
