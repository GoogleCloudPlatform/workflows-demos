# This is an example to show how to have a workflow wait for human approval from
# Google Sheets:
#
# 1. A workflow runs some initial steps.
# 2. The workflow creates a callback, saves the callback info to a Google Sheets
#    spreadsheet, and starts to wait for an approval from a human for the rest of
#    the steps.
# 3. A human sends his/her approval via the Google Sheets spreadsheet.
# 4. The workflow receives the approval and runs the rest of the steps.
